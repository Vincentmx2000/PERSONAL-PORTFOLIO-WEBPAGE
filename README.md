DESCRIPTION:

My personal portfolio website is a reflection of who I am — a passionate learner, aspiring developer, and creative thinker who is constantly growing and evolving. Built with a clean, modern design and responsive layout, this site is a digital space that represents my journey, skills, and ambitions. As someone pursuing a Master of Computer Applications and deeply interested in game development and graphics programming, this portfolio is not just a showcase of my technical work but also my personality and dedication to self-improvement.

The homepage welcomes visitors with a brief introduction — who I am, what I do, and what drives me. It's simple, bold, and direct. The goal here isn’t to impress with flashy animations but to create a genuine first impression that speaks to both professionalism and passion. I believe in clarity and purpose, and that’s reflected right from the start.

The "About Me" section goes a little deeper. It shares a bit of my personal story: how I got into programming, how I balance creativity with logic, and why I’m so driven to explore fields like game development. I also touch on my love for art — especially pencil sketching — and how that creative side shapes the way I approach both coding and design. I'm not just building projects to finish assignments; I'm trying to build things that help me learn, challenge me, and reflect what I care about.

The "Skills" section is where I outline the tools and technologies I’m currently working with. From frontend essentials like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to growing comfort with backend technologies, I’m actively learning and experimenting. As someone who spends hours each day coding, sketching, or researching, this section grows alongside me. I’ve also included some of the tools I use in my artistic workflow, because I believe that creativity and logic go hand in hand — especially in areas like game development and user experience.

The "Projects" section is the heart of the site. Here, I’ve highlighted real work — including web apps, a real-time chat application, a quiz app, and an e-learning platform interface. Each project comes with a brief description, tech stack, live link, and code repository. These aren’t just class assignments — they’re attempts to solve real problems, test my limits, and push myself to build better.

In the "Education" section, I share details of my academic path and current studies. I see education as more than just grades — it's about growth, understanding, and application. This section is meant to show where I’m coming from and how I’m preparing myself for a future in tech.

Finally, the "Contact" page is a simple, clean space where visitors can reach out — whether for collaboration, feedback, or just a conversation. I’m always open to learning from others, and this portfolio is one way to invite that dialogue.

Overall, my portfolio is a space that blends who I am with what I do — a work in progress, just like me. It’s where I share not only what I’ve built, but what I’m becoming.
